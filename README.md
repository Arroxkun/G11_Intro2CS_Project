# RTOS Framework Project. G11 

This project is designed to follow the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) framework. It consists of three main tasks, each implemented as a class. An object of each task is declared and added to the scheduler.

## Project Overview

1. **Task 1: Clone Climate Info from OpenWeatherMap**
   - This task is responsible for fetching climate information from the OpenWeatherMap API. It demonstrates how to use an API to collect weather data and showcases the multitasking capabilities of the RTOS.

2. **Task 2: Disease Detection using AI Model**
   - Task 2 showcases the power of artificial intelligence by utilizing an AI model for disease detection. 

3. **Task 3: CNN Image Classification with PyTorch**
   - Task 3 focuses on computer vision and deep learning, using the PyTorch library to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying five different flower species based on images. This task demonstrates the application of deep learning in an RTOS environment.
